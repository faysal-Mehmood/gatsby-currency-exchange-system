We record all such telephone calls and in the event of any dispute, the transcript of our telephone conversation may be used as evidence as to the terms of the agreement that was entered into.</p>

              <p>Out-of-Market Quotes - If we quote you a Rate that is clearly a mistake on our part ("Out-of-Market Quote") as the result of a technical or human error, it is not binding on us. You must notify us as soon as the mistake comes to your attention and we will requote the Rate as soon as possible</p>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p>FX Rates - You acknowledge that exchange rates can fluctuate rapidly and that we constantly update our quoted FX Rates. There are the following different mechanisms for Rate calculations:</p>
              <ol class="list list--ordered">
                 <li>
                    <p>Normal and Priority Transactions: We will quote you a dealable Foreign Exchange ("FX") rate when you enter your transaction and receive a Transaction ID from us.</p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <p>Urgent transactions have two mechanisms:</p>
                    <ol class="list list--ordered">
                       <li>
                          <p>Indicative quote: we will quote an indicative rate at time you enter your transaction. Your rate will be confirmed at the time we transfer to your beneficiary’s bank account.</p>
                       </li>
                       <li>
                          <p>Fixed Rate: for smaller transactions we may quote a fixed rate at the time of transfer.</p>

              </ol>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p>Urgent Transactions Beneficial Rate Movement: If the FX rate in between the time the Transaction is placed and when we receive your funds moves for you we will not pay you any of the difference.</p>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p>FX Rate Source - we have sole responsibility to determine what FX rates will be used to determine any FX rate we display to you. Our FX rates will update in real time or any period we deem suitable.</p>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p>Intermediary and Beneficiary Banking Fees and Charges: We may use third party suppliers and Intermediary and Beneficiary banks who may deduct fees from your transaction. Given the huge number of possible correspondent and beneficiary banks and their different charging methodologies, we are unable to advise you of the amount of these fees and charges at the time you entering the online transaction. It is your responsibility to contact your beneficiary’s bank to determine any fees and charges they may levy on your transaction.</p>
           </li>
           <li>
              <p>Pay a Bill: We will pay your bill as per your instructions entered in the bill beneficiary on our system. This payment will occur within one week. Any rejected bill payments, will mean we charge you $AUD50 to reprocess to the correct bill beneficiary or refund your amount.</p>

  ## Transaction


  1. Transaction: A Transaction can be placed either through our website or telephone. A Transaction is created once you give us your instructions in accordance with this paragraph 4 and 5.

  2. Online Auto Confirmation - If you enter into an online transaction through our website, the Transaction will be legally binding on you as soon as we receive your electronic Instructions. We will provide you with confirmation of the Transaction Details on the screen and via email at the time you book the Transaction, but we will not provide you with any subsequent confirmation of any kind unless you request it.

  3. Online Booking Confirmation - If you book a Transaction online that is not an Auto-Confirmation Transaction, we will attempt to contact you by telephone within 15 minutes on a "business day" and during "business hours" of your online booking to confirm the Transaction details. Outside of business hours we will contact you immediately the next business day. The Transaction will be legally binding on you at the conclusion of the telephone call. If we cannot contact you by telephone on the number you have given to us within 15 minutes, we reserve the right to cancel the booking and not enter into the Transaction.

  4. Telephone Booking - If you book a Transaction by telephone, the Transaction will be legally binding at the conclusion of the telephone call. We will send you an email headed "Transaction Confirmation". If there is any discrepancy between the Transaction Confirmation and the details of the Transaction that have already been agreed in the telephone conversation, you must contact us within 24 hours of receipt of the Transaction Confirmation, failing which the Transaction details in the Transaction Confirmation will be deemed to be correct. We record all such telephone calls and in the event of any dispute, the transcript of our telephone conversation may be used as evidence as to the terms of the agreement that was entered into.

  5. Cancellation - Once you enter a Transaction it is legally binding. We do not allow the cancellation of the transaction through our website. If you want to cancel the transaction before we receive your funds into our account, then a AUD $50 fee will be liable to be paid by you. To cancel the transaction you must contact us via the contact us information on our website. Once we have received your funds, you cannot cancel the transaction.

  6. Late Payment - we reserve the right to cancel your transaction if we do not receive your funds within 1 business days of entering a transaction. An AUD $50 fee will be liable to be paid by you. We will either invoice you directly for this late payment fee or deduct it from your next transaction.

  7. Out-of-Market Quotes - If we quote you a Rate that is clearly a mistake on our part ("Out-of-Market Quote") as the result of a technical or human error, it is not binding on us. You must notify us as soon as the mistake comes to your attention and we will requote the Rate as soon as possible

  8. FX Rates - You acknowledge that exchange rates can fluctuate rapidly and that we constantly update our quoted FX Rates. There are the following different mechanisms for Rate calculations:

     1. Normal and Priority Transactions: We will quote you a dealable Foreign Exchange ("FX") rate when you enter your transaction and receive a Transaction ID from us.
     2. Urgent transactions have two mechanisms:

        1. Indicative quote: we will quote an indicative rate at time you enter your transaction. Your rate will be confirmed at the time we transfer to your beneficiary’s bank account.
        2. Fixed Rate: for smaller transactions we may quote a fixed rate at the time of transfer.
        3. Pay a Bill: We will quote you a dealable Foreign Exchange ("FX") rate when you enter your transaction and receive a Transaction ID from us.
  9. Urgent Transactions Beneficial Rate Movement: If the FX rate in between the time the Transaction is placed and when we receive your funds moves for you we will not pay you any of the difference.

  10. FX Rate Source - we have sole responsibility to determine what FX rates will be used to determine any FX rate we display to you. Our FX rates will update in real time or any period we deem suitable.

  11. Intermediary and Beneficiary Banking Fees and Charges: We may use third party suppliers and Intermediary and Beneficiary banks who may deduct fees from your transaction. Given the huge number of possible correspondent and beneficiary banks and their different charging methodologies, we are unable to advise you of the amount of these fees and charges at the time you entering the online transaction. It is your responsibility to contact your beneficiary’s bank to determine any fees and charges they may levy on your transaction.

  12. Pay a Bill: We will pay your bill as per your instructions entered in the bill beneficiary on our system. This payment will occur within one week. Any rejected bill payments, will mean we charge you $AUD50 to reprocess to the correct bill beneficiary or refund your amount.
