  On Documents


  We are 100% compliant with all governing bodies. Since we are registered legally with AUSTRAC, their rules and policies require 2 different documents to identify a user. Both documents should be government-issued (Passport, Driver’s License, Australia Photo Card, etc.) If the document is taken from a copy, we will not be able to accept it.


  On Providing Reason for Transfer


  Each user of Smartway System will have to choose the objective of the money transfer according to the regulations and policy of Australia's AML/CFT Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism.


  On Large Transfers


  Smartway System is very strict on transactions at or over $5,000, to prevent frauds and money laundering and terrorism financing. Smartway will contact you for further documentation if you are sending over $5,000.
