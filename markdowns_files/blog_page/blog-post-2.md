  ## Retiring in Thailand as an Australian


  Retirement and stress are two words that should ideally never meet. But for many in Australia, the increasing cost of living has turned life post-work into a stressful thought. Retirees that wish to downsize in Sydney might end up paying more than their current house is worth!


  With a high quality of life and a low cost of living, an increasing number of retirees choose to call Thailand home. It makes sense - people can afford certain luxuries that aren’t accessible back home. After all, you didn’t spend the last 40 years at work to carry out your Golden years in the same neighborhood. People deserve excitement - cities like Bangkok and Chiang Mai offer that feeling.


  It’s quite clear why Thailand is reveled as the ‘Land of Smiles’. It’s a combination of the friendly culture, jaw-dropping sunsets, and the fact that over[215 Michelin-awarded restaurants exist in the country](<>)(many of which cost less than AUD $3/meal).


  So how do people make it work?


  Let’s be straightforward - we’re not here to say that expatriate life in Thailand is a walk in the park. Just ask any expat currently living in Thailand about the bureaucratic hoops they jump through - it can be annoying. However, it’s important to remember that a quarterly inconvenience is significantly simpler than the visa process of other retirement destinations.


  ## Visa Requirements


  Retirement Visas in Thailand are valid in 1-year intervals. At the end of each year, you need to leave the country and re-apply for the program or renew your visa at the immigration centers around the country.


  [Every 90 days](<>), you need to visit these immigration centers anyway to formally check-in. Retirement Visas prohibit employment in the country, so if your goal is to work part-time, you will need to apply for a Work Visa, instead. Unfortunately, this also applies to long-term charity work.


  In order to obtain a Retirement Visa, you must prove that your bank account contains certain funds. Thailand simply wants to understand that you are in solid financial standings if you’re staying in their country. Proof of funds can be demonstrated through a lump sum in your bank account or alternatively, a monthly income. If you need to transfer money into a specific bank account for the Retirement Visa check, don’t worry. Smartway System has the best rates around.


  ## Pension


  Can you receive your Australian Pension while living in Thailand? Yes. To meet Social Security/Centrelink/Human Services requirements, you must occasionally return to Australia to restart your allotted period of time abroad. In the eyes of the Australian Government, this will ensure you are still legally eligible to receive Pension payments.


  Your Part Pension can assist you in meeting the Retirement Visa expectations, but will not be enough to cover the total financial requirements (AU $1,800 - $1,850 depending on the Exchange Rate).


  The Pension works a bit differently for those living overseas. For those gone over a year, payments will occur every 4 weeks (instead of every 2 weeks). These payments often require a week before arriving to foreign bank accounts.


  Questions about[health insurance](<>), financial planning, and international living can seem intimidating at first. There are countless blogs available to address these needs and concerns - we recommend[The Thailand Life](<>). It’s a great resource for those new to international living in Thailand. It can certainly be challenging to live in a foreign country but the joy, excitement, and new experiences that await you certainly surpass those challenges.


  From Phuket to Pattaya, thousands of Australians make it work. According to ABS data, 11,660 Australians over the age of 55 permanently relocated to foreign countries in 2016, compared to only 7,910 in 2005.


  Foreign visitors will never experience a shortage of fascinating Buddhist temples, beautiful natural landscapes, or welcoming rural villages. Thailand is truly the perfect country for Australian retirees to have their cake and eat it, too.
